A repository for test scripts for Web Tech


For commiting and working with git and github, use the following commands;

$ git clone *link copied from github*   
$ cd *repos name*/                         
$ git status                                

This is to create the repository, once you have finished adding things and working on it, to commit;

$ git add .                                 
$ git commit -m "*message about what has been commited*"
$ git push
